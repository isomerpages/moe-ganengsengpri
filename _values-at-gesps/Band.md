**Teacher 1 I/C:**&nbsp;**[Mrs Lilian Lim](mailto:ho_lilian@schools.gov.sg)**&nbsp;<br>

The members in our Brass Band are selected through audition when they are 8 years old. They meet for regular practices twice per week to learn how to play the instrument as an individual and collaboratively and musically as a team. Our band takes pride in participating in the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation, overseas competitions and music exchanges with schools in Australia, Hong Kong and Japan.
