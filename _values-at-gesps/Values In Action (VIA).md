### Values In Action (VIA)

Values-In Action (VIA) in Gan Eng Seng Primary School’s Values-In-Action (VIA)&nbsp; consists of a&nbsp; 6 year spiral up design-thinking principles based learning experiences which allow students to understand bigger concepts as they grow older and learn to be citizens with heart through social innovation.&nbsp;

In order to develop&nbsp;_GESPians_&nbsp;into Citizens with Heart, GESPS Primary 1 to Primary 6 VIA learning experiences are designed based on the school&nbsp; INSPIRE Values (Integrity, Self-discipline, Perseverance, Inclusiveness, Respect and Empathy) , focusing on nurturing gratitude in our students.&nbsp; We want&nbsp;_GESPians_&nbsp;to feel grateful and appreciative for the opportunities, gifts, and kindness that others bestow upon them. Embracing this heart of gratitude,&nbsp;_GESPians_&nbsp;will learn to care for others and contribute activity to the community.

**Primary 1 Bringing Cheers to My Family Members**

Our P1 GESPians reflect on what their family members have done for them and learn to be thankful to&nbsp; their family members for all the love and care shown. In order to show their appreciation, our students carry out acts of cheers for their family members.

**Primary 2 GESPS Non-Teaching Staff Appreciation Day**

Our students are truly appreciative of what our non-teaching staff has done, they also recorded short videos expressing their gratitude to them.

**Primary 3 Let's Stop Food Wastage**

Our P3 GESPians learn about food wastage and brainstorm on ways to stop food wastage in their daily life. They share what they have learnt with their family members and encourage their family members to take part in the clean plate challenge as part of their efforts to reduce food wastage.
