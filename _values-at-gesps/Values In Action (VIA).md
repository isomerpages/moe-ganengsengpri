<p align="justify">Values-In Action (VIA) in Gan Eng Seng Primary School’s Values-In-Action
(VIA)&nbsp; consists of a&nbsp; 6 year spiral up design-thinking principles
based learning experiences which allow students to understand bigger concepts
as they grow older and learn to be citizens with heart through social innovation.&nbsp;</p>

<p align="justify">In order to develop&nbsp; <em>GESPians</em> into Citizens with Heart, GESPS
Primary 1 to Primary 6 VIA learning experiences are designed based on the
school&nbsp; INSPIRE Values (Integrity, Self-discipline, Perseverance,
Inclusiveness, Respect and Empathy) , focusing on nurturing gratitude in
our students.&nbsp; We want&nbsp; <em>GESPians</em> to feel grateful and
appreciative for the opportunities, gifts, and kindness that others bestow
upon them. Embracing this heart of gratitude,&nbsp;<em>GESPians</em> will
learn to care for others and contribute activity to the community.</p>

##### Primary 2 SMRT - Redhill MRT Station

<p align="justify">P2 <i>GESPians</i> spread their kindness to the fellow commuters at SMRT Redhill
MRT station by distributing their handmade wands. The wands carry positive
messages to encourage commuters to start their day right and keep their
spirits high. During the COVID period, commuters kept much to themselves
and minimized interaction. The idea of using handwands to encourage fellow
commuters to interact by waving came about.</p>
