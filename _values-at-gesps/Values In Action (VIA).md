<p align="justify">Values-In Action (VIA) in Gan Eng Seng Primary School’s Values-In-Action (VIA)&nbsp; consists of a&nbsp; 6 year spiral up design-thinking principles based learning experiences which allow students to understand bigger concepts as they grow older and learn to be citizens with heart through social innovation.&nbsp;</p>

<p align="justify">In order to develop&nbsp; <i>GESPians</i> into Citizens with Heart, GESPS Primary 1 to Primary 6 VIA learning experiences are designed based on the school&nbsp; INSPIRE Values (Integrity, Self-discipline, Perseverance, Inclusiveness, Respect and Empathy) , focusing on nurturing gratitude in our students.&nbsp; We want&nbsp; <i>GESPians</i> to feel grateful and appreciative for the opportunities, gifts, and kindness that others bestow upon them. Embracing this heart of gratitude,&nbsp;<i>GESPians</i> will learn to care for others and contribute activity to the community.</p>

##### Primary 1 - My First Skool
