<p>Values-In Action (VIA) in Gan Eng Seng Primary School’s Values-In-Action
(VIA)&nbsp; consists of a&nbsp; 6 year spiral up design-thinking principles
based learning experiences which allow students to understand bigger concepts
as they grow older and learn to be citizens with heart through social innovation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to develop&nbsp; <em>GESPians</em> into Citizens with Heart, GESPS
Primary 1 to Primary 6 VIA learning experiences are designed based on the
school&nbsp; INSPIRE Values (Integrity, Self-discipline, Perseverance,
Inclusiveness, Respect and Empathy) , focusing on nurturing gratitude in
our students.&nbsp; We want&nbsp; <em>GESPians</em> to feel grateful and
appreciative for the opportunities, gifts, and kindness that others bestow
upon them. Embracing this heart of gratitude,&nbsp;<em>GESPians</em> will
learn to care for others and contribute activity to the community.</p>
<h5>Primary 1 - My First Skool</h5>
<p>P1 <em>GESPians</em> demonstrate empathy when they show understanding that
K2 preschoolers will be overwhelmed by the transition to formal education
in the following year. Along with their teachers, they plan a day of school
experience for the K2 preschoolers to allay their anxiety and show the
joy of learning in school.</p>

<p>Our P1 <em>GESPians</em> are guiding the K2 in the drawing and colouring
exercise</p>
<p>Having recess together is a good way to our <em>GESPians</em> to bond with
the K2 preschoolers</p>
<h5>Primary 2 GESPS Non-Teaching Staff Appreciation Day</h5>
<p>Every P2 student writes notes of appreciation for our school non-teaching
staff such as the office staff,&nbsp; security officers, school cleaners
etc for keeping the school clean and safe for them during this pandemic.
Our students are truly appreciative of what our non-teaching staff has
done, they also recorded short videos expressing their gratitude to them.</p>

<h5>Primary 3 Let's Stop Food Wastage</h5>
<p>Our P3 GESPians learn about food wastage and brainstorm on ways to stop
food wastage in their daily life. They share what they have learnt with
their family members and encourage their family members to take part in
the clean plate challenge as part of their efforts to reduce food wastage.</p>
