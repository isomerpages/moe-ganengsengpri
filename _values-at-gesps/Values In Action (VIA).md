<p>Values-In Action (VIA) in Gan Eng Seng Primary School’s Values-In-Action
(VIA)&nbsp; consists of a&nbsp; 6 year spiral up design-thinking principles
based learning experiences which allow students to understand bigger concepts
as they grow older and learn to be citizens with heart through social innovation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to develop&nbsp; <em>GESPians</em> into Citizens with Heart, GESPS
Primary 1 to Primary 6 VIA learning experiences are designed based on the
school&nbsp; INSPIRE Values (Integrity, Self-discipline, Perseverance,
Inclusiveness, Respect and Empathy) , focusing on nurturing gratitude in
our students.&nbsp; We want&nbsp; <em>GESPians</em> to feel grateful and
appreciative for the opportunities, gifts, and kindness that others bestow
upon them. Embracing this heart of gratitude,&nbsp;<em>GESPians</em> will
learn to care for others and contribute activity to the community.</p>
<h5>Primary 1 - My First Skool</h5>
<p>P1 <em>GESPians</em> demonstrate empathy when they show understanding that
K2 preschoolers will be overwhelmed by the transition to formal education
in the following year. Along with their teachers, they plan a day of school
experience for the K2 preschoolers to allay their anxiety and show the
joy of learning in school.</p>

<p>Getting the K2 preschoolers to experience learning in the classroom</p>
<h5>Primary 2 SMRT - Redhill MRT Station</h5>
<p>P2 GEPSians spread their kindness to the fellow commuters at SMRT Redhill
MRT station by distributing their handmade wands. The wands carry positive
messages to encourage commuters to start their day right and keep their
spirits high. During the COVID period, commuters kept much to themselves
and minimized interaction. The idea of using handwands to encourage fellow
commuters to interact by waving came about.</p>

<h5>Primary 3 Let's Stop Food Wastage</h5>
<p>Our P3 GESPians learn about food wastage and brainstorm on ways to stop
food wastage in their daily life. They share what they have learnt with
their family members and encourage their family members to take part in
the clean plate challenge as part of their efforts to reduce food wastage.</p>

the students to be service ambassadors at Redhill MRT station. The students’
responsibilities include helping commuters with directions, lending a hand
at the ticketing machines and ensuring that the elderly and those in need
