#### Overview of Student Leadership in GESPS

Student Leadership in GESPS adopts the Learn-Lead-Lift (L3) approach.

<p align="justify">Under the ‘Learn’ stage, all students would be given opportunities to learn to be leaders either during FTGP lessons or through cohort training for the Primary 4 and 5 students. At this stage, students will also be given opportunities to be in class-based leadership positions and they include monitors, assistant monitors as well as group leaders.</p>

<p align="justify">The ‘Lead’ stage will involve selected students being given a bigger leadership role. These roles would include CCE ambassadors and subject representatives who would lead in level-wide events. At the ‘lift’ stage, students will be given school-based leadership positions and they include peer support leaders, CCA leaders and prefects.</p>

<p align="justify">Forming the Executive Committee (EXCO) are the Head Prefect, Vice Head Prefect, Committee Head (Welfare), Committee Head (Sports), Committee Head (AV/ICT) and Committee Head (Discipline) respectively. The organisation chart of prefects is summarised below.</p>

Each committee has its area of specialisation. Prefect meetings are held monthly to communicate information as well as to conduct trainings so that prefects can carry out their roles effectively.&nbsp;

A key&nbsp;programme&nbsp;of the&nbsp;Prefectorial&nbsp;Board is the annual Prefect Investiture. It is a ceremony that formally officiates and congratulates the appointments of the prefects.&nbsp;Due to the Covid-19 situation, our Prefect Investiture this year, was held virtually. Here&nbsp;are some photos of Prefect Investiture&nbsp;2020.
