#### Overview of Student Leadership in GESPS

Student Leadership in GESPS adopts the Learn-Lead-Lift (L3) approach.

<p align="justify">Under the ‘Learn’ stage, all students would be given opportunities to learn to be leaders through CCE (FTGP) lessons and the appointment of class-based leaders.</p>

<p align="justify">The ‘Lead’ stage provides students with opportunities to step up and serve as leaders. They are involved in class-based leadership training. During the class-based leadership training for Primary 3 to Primary 6, students who are given leadership positions in class (monitors, subject representatives and other leadership roles) will be inducted in the roles so that they are able to better perform their leadership duties.</p>.

<p align="justify"> At the ‘Lift’ stage, students will be given school-based leadership positions and these include Prefects, Peer Support Leaders and CCA Leaders. Through the various appointed leadership roles, students develop interpersonal skills to influence and lead those around them through school-wide events.</p>

Prefect meetings are held monthly to communicate information as well as to conduct trainings. During training, prefects can develop their leadership competencies with a focus on personal effectiveness, sound values and a good understanding of self to perform their roles and responsibilities purposefully and effectively.

The Design Thinking Principles is adopted in the training of the prefects so that they are able to develop the ability to respond to new challenges, possess risk-taking abilities and the ability to embrace failure through problem-solving situations where they continuously learn, adapt, and grow, as well as develop an appreciation for the value of hard work and teamwork.

A key programme of the Prefectorial Board is the annual Prefect Investiture. It is a ceremony that formally officiates and congratulates the appointments of the prefects by the school population. This is to affirm the effort and service rendered by the prefects.</p>
