#### Overview of Student Leadership in GESPS

Student Leadership in GESPS adopts the Learn-Lead-Lift (L3) approach.

<p align="justify">Under the ‘Learn’ stage, all students would be given opportunities to learn to be leaders through CCE (FTGP) lessons and the appointment of class-based leaders.</p>

<p align="justify">The ‘Lead’ stage provides students with opportunities to step up and serve as leaders. They are involved in class-based leadership training. During the class-based leadership training for Primary 3 to Primary 6, students who are given leadership positions in class (monitors, subject representatives and other leadership roles) will be inducted in the roles so that they are able to better perform their leadership duties.</p>.

<p align="justify"> At the ‘Lift’ stage, students will be given school-based leadership positions and these include Prefects, Peer Support Leaders and CCA Leaders. Through the various appointed leadership roles, students develop interpersonal skills to influence and lead those around them through school-wide events.</p>

Prefect meetings are held monthly to communicate information as well as to conduct trainings. During training, prefects can develop their leadership competencies with a focus on personal effectiveness, sound values and a good understanding of self to perform their roles and responsibilities purposefully and effectively.

The Design Thinking Principles is adopted in the training of the prefects so that they are able to develop the ability to respond to new challenges, possess risk-taking abilities and the ability to embrace failure through problem-solving situations where they continuously learn, adapt, and grow, as well as develop an appreciation for the value of hard work and teamwork.

A key programme of the Prefectorial Board is the annual Prefect Investiture. It is a ceremony that formally officiates and congratulates the appointments of the prefects by the school population. This is to affirm the effort and service rendered by the prefects.</p>

###### **Prefect Investiture 2024**

<p align="justify">
The Prefect Investiture Ceremony on July 29, 2024, was a significant event, held in the school hall during the Monday assembly session. It was witnessed by all Primary 1 to Primary 6 students and marked the official appointment of our Primary 4 and Primary 5 Prefects.</p>
<p align="justify">
This year was particularly noteworthy as the school appointed its new 2024-2025 Head Prefect, Low Yong Qi from class 5 Empathy. The ceremony began with an inspiring address by the Principal, Mr. Roy Lee, who urged the prefects to be dedicated, committed leaders and role models who <b>INSPIRE</b> and motivate their peers by doing the right things and showing kindness. He emphasized the importance of embodying the qualities of a true leader.</p>
<p align="justify">
Following the Principal's speech, the prefects donned their Prefects’ badges. Head Prefect Yong Qi then delivered a short speech and led the entire prefectorial contingent in reciting the Prefects’ Pledge. It was indeed a proud moment for all the prefects, marking a significant day in their leadership journey. This milestone serves as a reminder to all the prefects to uphold the highest standards of excellence as they strive to serve the school.</p>
<p align="justify">
We would like to express our heartfelt appreciation to our Primary 6 Prefects for their dedication and commitment in their prefectorial work. We want to wish them all the best in their future endeavour and to continue to be leaders who inspire! To our newly appointed prefects, our heartiest congratulations!
