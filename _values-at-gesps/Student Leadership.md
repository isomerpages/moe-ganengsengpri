#### Overview of Student Leadership in GESPS

Student Leadership in GESPS adopts the Learn-Lead-Lift (L3) approach.

<p align="justify">Under the ‘Learn’ stage, all students would be given opportunities to learn to be leaders through CCE (FTGP) lessons and the appointment of class-based leaders.</p>

<p align="justify">The ‘Lead’ stage provides students with opportunities to step up and serve as leaders. They are involved in class-based leadership training. During the class-based leadership training for Primary 3 to Primary 6, students who are given leadership positions in class (monitors, subject representatives and other leadership roles) will be inducted in the roles so that they are able to better perform their leadership duties.</p>.

<p align="justify"> At the ‘Lift’ stage, students will be given school-based leadership positions and these include Prefects, Peer Support Leaders and CCA Leaders. Through the various appointed leadership roles, students develop interpersonal skills to influence and lead those around them through school-wide events.</p>

Prefect meetings are held monthly to communicate information as well as to conduct trainings. During training, prefects can develop their leadership competencies with a focus on personal effectiveness, sound values and a good understanding of self to perform their roles and responsibilities purposefully and effectively.

The Design Thinking Principles is adopted in the training of the prefects so that they are able to develop the ability to respond to new challenges, possess risk-taking abilities and the ability to embrace failure through problem-solving situations where they continuously learn, adapt, and grow, as well as develop an appreciation for the value of hard work and teamwork.

A key programme of the Prefectorial Board is the annual Prefect Investiture. It is a ceremony that formally officiates and congratulates the appointments of the prefects by the school population. This is to affirm the effort and service rendered by the prefects.</p>

###### **Prefect Investiture 2025-2026**

<p align="justify">
On 4 August 2025, we held our Student Leadership Investiture Ceremony to celebrate and officially appoint our student leaders. This year’s ceremony was especially meaningful as, for the first time, we also honoured our Peer Support Leaders and CCA Leaders alongside the Prefectorial Board.</p>
<p align="justify">
The event recognised students who have stepped up to lead, serve, and inspire their peers — each playing a part in building a caring and vibrant school community. During the ceremony, school leaders presented certificates to the newly appointed leaders, symbolising the trust placed in them to lead with humility, empathy, and purpose.</p>
<p align="justify">
This year, Maruyama Sofu was appointed Head Prefect, together with the Prefectorial Executive Committee — Jacob Chong (Vice-Head Prefect), Ewan Tan, Iyer Padma, and Samuel Henry Ezerman. They will lead the prefectorial board for the year 2025 and 2026.</p>
<p align="justify">
Our CCA Leaders and Peer Support Leaders also pledged to lead with teamwork, responsibility, and care. Whether guiding their teams, supporting peers, or representing the school, they exemplify what it means to lead through service and positive influence.
We look forward to seeing our student leaders uphold our INSPIRE values and continue making Gan Eng Seng Primary School a place where everyone can be a confident communicator, a creative and critical thinker, and a curious learner. Congratulations to the student leaders!

###### **Prefects Leadership Skills Enrichment Day 2025**
<p align="justify">
The Prefects Leadership Skills Training, grounded in design thinking, empowers our prefects to understand real school issues from multiple perspectives and develop thoughtful, student-centred solutions. Through empathising and reflecting, prefects learn to think creatively and critically while collaborating effectively with others. This approach nurtures adaptable, empathetic leaders who are confident problem-solvers and proactive in improving the school community and beyond.</p>

###### **Class Leadership Training 2026**
<p align="justify">
The Class Leadership Training is a structured programme designed to develop responsible and confident student leaders within the classroom. The programme equips students with essential leadership skills such as effective communication, teamwork, problem-solving, and decision-making in their subject-specific area.
Grounded in INSPIRE values, the leadership training encourages students to lead by example and take ownership of their responsibilities. Students are guided to support their peers, manage challenges constructively, and contribute positively to a cohesive class environment.
Through this training, students are empowered to grow in character and leadership, enabling them to serve their class effectively and contribute meaningfully to the school community.
