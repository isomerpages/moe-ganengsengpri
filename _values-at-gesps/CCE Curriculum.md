<p align="justify">In Gan Eng Seng Primary School, we believe in developing Learners with Grit, Citizens with Heart. We adopt a holistic approach which provides students with the opportunities to explore real-world scenarios, embrace challenges and reflect on their experiences. Through these learning experiences and skillful CCE facilitation by our teachers, we develop our students into empathetic and socially responsible individuals with strong values.</p>

##### Our Programmes &amp; Activities

Learning programmes and experiences both within and outside the classrooms are designed with intentionality, to help our students develop the desired values, social-emotional competencies and citizenship dispositions. To develop our <i>GESPians</i> holistically, we have designed and planned key Student Development Experiences (SDEs) for all our students to explore, ask questions, and reflect on their values and behaviors. Some of the activities include cohort learning journeys (LJs), Trips for International Experience (TIE), Values-in-Action (VIA), Education and Career Guidance (ECG) activities, National Education (NE) Commemorative Days as well as assembly talks.

###### **Learning Journeys**

P2 <i>GESPians</i> had their learning journey around the Redhill neighbourhood to understand how common spaces in their immediate environment create common experiences as a nation, and what they can do to take personal responsibility in caring for these spaces.

<p align="justify">To enrich students’ learning, <i>GESPians</i> are empowered to conduct their own research on culture of these ASEAN countries and present their project to the school during assembly. They were also given the opportunity to host foreign students from Thailand during a school visit.</p>

###### **Initiatives for National Education and Developing Active Citizenship**

<p align="justify">It is important for students to explore the national identity, understand the realities and challenges of the nation and develop their sense of belonging to Singapore. To create opportunities for exploration, the school organises activities that allow our students to play contributory roles in their immediate communities and in the nation.</p>

<p align="justify">During <b>Total Defence Day</b>, students experienced the water rationing and power disruption exercises to understand the vulnerabilities of Singapore and how they can play their part in Total Defence. To encourage fellow <i>GESPians</i> to use water wisely, CCE Ambassadors took the lead and stationed themselves at the rationing point, The school also partnered Queenstown Secondary School NCDCC students to conduct an assembly talk on Digital Defence and students were engaged by their sharing. Lessons on basic first aid and community preparedness were also conducted during Physical Education and Social Studies classes to equip students with the relevant life skills and knowledge</p>

<p align="justify">What would be a better way to learn about global awareness than to interact with and learn from your own peers? During <b>International Friendship Day</b>, international students shared with the school on their cultures, languages, and their daily life practices. This sharing has broadened our students’ understanding and appreciation of the world beyond their immediate environment. Through their sharing, GESPians learn to be more empathetic and open-minded, appreciating the similarities and differences that make each culture unique.</p>

The school also celebrated Singapore’s milestone and achievement by getting GESPians to put up a concert during **National Day Celebration**. Through these collective experiences of celebration, students have a deepened appreciation and a sense of pride for the nation.</p>
