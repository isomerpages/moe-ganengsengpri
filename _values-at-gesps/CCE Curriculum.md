<p align="justify">In GESPS, we are guided by three principles when inculcating values and building competencies in our students. There are:</p>

###### 1) Every Teacher A CCE Teacher

*   Every teacher, a role model who upholds sound values
*   Every teacher, a supportive adult who instills values in our students
*   Every teacher, a trusted educator who builds strong teacher-student relationships

**2) Engaging students through the Head, Hands, Heart approach**

*   We want to touch the HEARTS of students through equipping them with HEAD knowledge and providing them with opportunities to use their ‘HANDS’ to demonstrate social-emotional competencies and internalize values

**3) Parents, as partners in education**

*   Parents play a vital role in the education of their children
*   Children learn best when there is home-school partnership

##### The Spiraling Curriculum

<p align="justify">Based on Bronfenbrenner’s Ecological Systems Theory, the CCE lessons and activities spiral outwards through the gradual enlargement of the environment which a student interacts in during his 6 years in the school.</p>

<p align="justify">To better inculcate 21st&nbsp;century learners with the right values on and offline, the school put together a cyberwellness program that advocates students to exhibit positive behavior when using ICT. Students are taught and reminded of the cyberwellness messages during ICT programmes and lessons.</p>
