<p align="justify">In Gan Eng Seng Primary School, we believe in developing Learners with Grit, Citizens with Heart. We adopt a holistic approach which provides students with the opportunities to explore real-world scenarios, embrace challenges and reflect on their experiences. Through these learning experiences and skillful CCE facilitation by our teachers, we develop our students into empathetic and socially responsible individuals with strong values.</p>

##### Our Programmes &amp; Activities

Learning programmes and experiences both within and outside the classrooms are designed with intentionality, to help our students develop the desired values, social-emotional competencies and citizenship dispositions. To develop our <i>GESPians</i> holistically, we have designed and planned key Student Development Experiences (SDEs) for all our students to explore, ask questions, and reflect on their values and behaviors. Some of the activities include cohort learning journeys (LJs), Trips for International Experience (TIE), Values-in-Action (VIA), Education and Career Guidance (ECG) activities, National Education (NE) Commemorative Days as well as assembly talks.

###### **Learning Journeys**

P2 <i>GESPians</i> had their learning journey around the Redhill neighbourhood to understand how common spaces in their immediate environment create common experiences as a nation, and what they can do to take personal responsibility in caring for these spaces.

Primary 4, 5 and 6 <i>GESPians</i> went for their museum-based learning where they learnt about the culture and heritage of different races in Singapore.

<p align="justify">To better inculcate 21st&nbsp;century learners with the right values on and offline, the school put together a cyberwellness program that advocates students to exhibit positive behavior when using ICT. Students are taught and reminded of the cyberwellness messages during ICT programmes and lessons.</p>
