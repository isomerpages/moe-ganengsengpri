## Science

The Science department strives to nurture _GESPians_ with a passion for Science and equip them with the skills for scientific inquiry. _GESPians_ are encouraged to be responsible for their own learning through inquiry which is characterised by the degree of responsibility they have in posing and responding to questions, designing investigations and evaluating and communicating their learning.

The school customises the teaching of Science to meet the learning needs of the students in the classroom and beyond the classroom.  Teachers are the 5E Instructional Model to frame the sequence and organisation of their lessons in the classroom. Strategies such as OCA (What do I Observe? What is the Concept? How do I Apply?) and investigatives and hands-on activities using learning tools are part of the repertoire of strategies used in the classroom teaching.

Beyond the classroom, _GESPians_ are empowered with experiences as an inquirer who would be able to enjoy Science and value Science as an important tool to help them explore the natural and physical world. These experiences include the P1 and P2 Science Exploration Day, Level Signature Programmes, P5 Stretch and Enrichment Programmes. Leveraging on the use of technology to boost the joy of learning, students are engaged in lessons through the use of ICT tools when they participate in the in-house Science Trail.

The Science department also spearheads various environmental awareness initiatives with key focus directed to green education and conservation. Besides embedding green education and conservation as part of students’ learning both in and out of classrooms, the school involves students in planning and communicating the importance of green efforts. These students, who are identified at the class level from Primary 1 to 6, are known as the Green Champs. They help to champion the school’s efforts in promoting a clean and green environment among the student body.

Assembly Talks on Environmental Issues are conducted to further anchor the message of a ‘Green School’. Yearly commemoration of the Earth Day in April is carried out to engage students in activities to increase their awareness about environmental protection and conservation.

Systems are also put in place to further model and anchor environmental protection among our staff – For instance, staff are encouraged to practice double-sided photocopying and use their own cutlery or lunchbox during meals instead of using the plastic utensils and styrofoam boxes. 

Through these, the school aims to instill in our _GESPians_ and staff the desire and passion to care for our living environment by adopting an eco-friendly lifestyle.
