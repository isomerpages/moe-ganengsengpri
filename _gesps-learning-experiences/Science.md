### Learning Science @GESPS

The Science department strives to nurture GESPians with a passion for Science who are active eco stewards of their environment. GESPians are encouraged to take ownership of their own learning through inquiry, which is characterised by the degree of responsibility they have in posing and responding to questions, designing investigations, and evaluating and communicating their learning. Through this, GESPians develop their scientific inquiry and reasoning skills, and become more confident communicators who are passionate about learning.

 

Beyond the classroom, GESPians are empowered with experiences as an inquirer who would be able to enjoy Science and value Science as an important tool to help them explore the natural and physical world. These experiences include the P1 and P2 Science Exploration Day, Level Signature Programmes, and other Special Programmes offered by the department.


### Embracing all Students – Curriculum Customisation
The school customises the teaching of Science to meet the learning needs of all students in the classroom and beyond the classroom.  Aligned with the school’s talent development framework, the department offers provisions for students to develop their interests and talents in Science at three levels, namely, Exposure, Experience and Excellence.

Provisions at the ‘Exposure’ level are for all students and aim to expose students to new interests and allow them to learn and strengthen foundational skills and 21st century competencies. Teachers use a variety of strategies to facilitate engaging and meaningful learning experiences in Science to support students’ learning. These include the use of OCA (What do I Observe? What is the Concept? How do I Apply?) to guide students in their scientific reasoning and communication of ideas, investigative projects, experiments as well as outdoor hands-on exploration activities. Where relevant, appropriate technology is also used to enhance students’ learning of science concepts and boost the joy of learning. 

Provisions at the ‘Experience’ level are voluntary and provided for students to explore and verify their interests and talents. These include in-class investigative projects and self-directed learning opportunities via the Student Learning Space.

Provisions at the ‘Excellence’ level aim to provide advanced learning opportunities for students who are ready for and motivated by challenging experiences. These include the Special Programmes offered by the department, such as  the Science Buskers Programme.
