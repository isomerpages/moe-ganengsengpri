### Talent Development Framework

To nurture all our students holistically to be lifelong ‘Learners with Grit, Citizens with Heart’, GESPS offers a wide range of opportunities for students to explore, develop and strengthen their talents. The talent development opportunities offered are categorized into four broad domains. 

1. Cognitive
2. Physical
3. Aesthetics
4. Social and Moral (Leadership and Character Development)
 
Provisions for talent development in each of the four domains are provided along three levels. 

Level 1 provisions (Exposure) are for all students and aim to expose students to new interests and allow them to learn and strengthen foundational skills and 21st century competencies.

Level 2 provisions (Experience) are provided to allow students to explore and verify their interests and talents. Students participate in these on a voluntary basis. These provisions usually require more commitment from students and take place over a longer period of time.
