#### Learning Mathematics @GESPS

<img src="/images/maths.jpg" style="width:35%" align=right>

To help our students build a strong foundation in Mathematics, our lessons are planned in a structured teaching sequence.<br>
Students will go through 3 phases of learning during a mathematics lesson, i.e. <b>Readiness, Engagement and Mastery phases.</b>

During the Readiness phase, teachers use activities to check on students’ prior knowledge to customize the lessons according to students' abilities. Different pedagogical approaches are used to engage students in learning new concepts and skills during the Engagement phase. Hands-on activities and collaborative learning activities are incorporated into this phase and students are encouraged to communicate and articulate their ideas during this phase of learning. Finally at the Mastery phase, learning is reinforced through practices, games, math journal and performance tasks.

Mathematical concepts are taught using the **Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract** **(CPA) approach**. Students engage in hands-on activities using concrete  materials and manipulatives to help them make sense of the concepts they are learning. Visual representations of the concrete manipulatives are then introduced to help students visualize the mathematical concepts. Finally, algorithms and symbols are used to represent the concepts in numerical operations. This CPA approach benefits all students as it slowly builds on students’ understanding of mathematical concepts in a progressive manner.

#### **Embracing all Students – Curriculum Customisation**

The **Stretch and Enrichment Programmes** are held after school to motivate students in the learning  of Mathematics based on their abilities. Activities include math games, puzzles and mathematical explorations in which students work independently or collaborate with their peers to engage in mathematical thinking.

To better challenge and stretch students who are passionate in Mathematics, selected students can take part in the **Math Olympiad Competitions** to broaden their horizons.

#### **Fostering the Joy of Learning – Special Programmes**

We believe in creating a conducive learning environment and engaging our students with the right learning experiences to make the learning of mathematics fun and purposeful.  Thus we leverage on the use of the environment as a 3rd Teacher to provide opportunities for children to make their thinking visible and deepen learning and increase engagement.
