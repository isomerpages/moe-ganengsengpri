## Mother Tongue

The Mother Tongue Department@GESPS strives to develop our _GESPians_ into confident individuals who are passionate in learning and are able to communicate effectively in their respective Mother Tongue Languages.

We strongly believe in creating a conducive environment that promotes language learning encompassed with cultural values. The department puts in place programmes to nurture the passion for heritage and culture among our pupils. Through recognition and appreciation of their own cultural identity, a sense of pride is instilled in our GESPians, thus inspiring them to excel in his/her Mother Tongue Language to the best of his/her ability.

Above the standard curriculum, the MT teachers take pride in customising and developing school based curriculum to provide various learning opportunities for our pupils. These approaches not only ignite the passion in MT but also enrich our pupils’ knowledge and propel them to learn beyond classrooms.
