## Educational Technology

#### Educational Technology Department

The school recognises the significance of developing 21st century competencies in the students and nurturing them to become responsible users of technology. To ensure that ICT positively impacts the teaching and learning process, the school is guided by MOE IT Masterplans. The ICT department carries out the Masterplans by providing essential support for teachers to capitalise on the affordances of technology to design, create and enact ICT-enriched lessons. It leverages the following key factors to achieve the above objective.

1 \. Build Teacher Capacity – Teachers are introduced to ICT tools and pedagogies through professional development workshops and sharing. With this support, teachers are able to build their capacity to design and carry out engaging ICT-enriched lessons in the classrooms.

2 \. Create Opportunities for Students to use ICT – Students are given ample opportunities to use ICT to enhance their learning experiences. With the Learning Management System (MCOnline) and Student Learning Space (SLS), the school will be able to better create and provide meaningful learning opportunities for the students to experience ICT.

The SLS is an online platform with tools and curriculum-aligned resources for all students to learn anytime, anywhere. With the SLS, students can take greater ownership of their learning and pick up skills and habits that prepare them for lifelong learning. Teachers will use the SLS to complement classroom teaching and learning through designing meaningful lessons for our GESPians.

3 \. Maintain a Reliable ICT Infrastructure – A reliable and updated infrastructure in school is necessary to create and sustain learning anytime, anywhere. The school undergoes periodic upgrading to enhance the school network and ICT infrastructure to better cater for learning through ICT and mobile devices in the school.

4 \. Collaboration with External Partners – Leverage the strength and expertise of external partners to value-add student’s learning through ICT. One such partner is Hewlett Packard Singapore. Volunteers from HP conducted a programme named “Hour of Code” for the Primary 3 students, introducing them to the fundamentals of coding. The programme excited the learners tremendously and spurred them on a path of self-discovery and continuous learning.
