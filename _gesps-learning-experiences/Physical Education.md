### Learning Physical Education @GESPS

As part of the school’s overall effort towards holistic learning, a child’s physical education at Gan Eng Seng Primary is guided by the 3 E approach. Our focus on developing the child in the physical domain would be defined by the following;


*   **Embrace**&nbsp;different talents and abilities  
    Through the teaching of 7 Learning Areas such as&nbsp;Games &amp; Sports, Dance, Gymnastics, Outdoor Education, Athletics and Swimming, every child will be taught skills that allow them to participate in physical activities.

* **Equip** our students with future ready skills
Students get to work in teams and strategise and create through play. (e.g. Future ready skills - Collaboration and Communication).

* **Empower** students to be confident and caring
Our lessons will bring out character traits such as resilience, care and teamwork.

#### Embracing all Students - Curriculum Customisation

  

Our Vision: Every&nbsp;_GESPian_&nbsp;an active and confident person who is INSPIRED (refer to school values).&nbsp;

  

Our Students need to be ready to face the rapidly-changing world while demonstrating resilience, empathy and good decision making. After 6 years at GESPS, our students should achieve the PE goals which are aligned to the national curriculum.  

  

Goal 1: Acquire a range of movement skills to participate in a variety of physical activities.&nbsp;

Goal 2: Understand and apply movement concepts, principles and strategies in a range of physical activities.&nbsp;

Goal 3: Demonstrate safe practices during physical and daily activities with respect to themselves, others and the environment.&nbsp;

Goal 4: Display positive personal and social behaviour across different experiences.&nbsp;

Goal 5: Acquire and maintain health-enhancing fitness through regular participation in physical activities.&nbsp;

Goal 6: Enjoy and value the benefits of living a physically active and healthy life.  

  

At the end of 6 years at Gan Eng Seng Primary, our students would have learned to;

* maintain an active healthy lifestyle
* be a resilient person
* exhibit good character traits and values

#### Fostering the Joy of Learning - Special Programmes

The physical education curriculum, including Programme for Active Learning (PAL), in our school helps pupils to strengthen relationships with their peers, develops discipline and perseverance, and improves self-confidence and self-esteem which is aligned to the Social Emotional Learning model.

  

**What is PAL?&nbsp;**

PAL provides diverse educational experiences by merging&nbsp;**classroom learning with outdoor activities**&nbsp;to encourage interest and inquisitiveness among pupils. 3 periods a week will be used to conduct modular activities in Sports and Outdoor Education, and the Performing and Visual Arts. Each class experiences different modules and rotate through the modules across 4 Semesters (across P1 &amp; P2).
