## Physical Education

**PE Department**<br>
As part of the school’s overall effort towards holistic learning, a child’s physical education at Gan Eng Seng Primary is guided by the 3 E approach. Our focus on developing the child in the physical domain would be defined by the following;

*   **Embrace** different talents and abilities → Through the teaching of 7 Learning Areas  
    – Games & Sports, Dance, Gymnastics, Outdoor Education, Athletics and Swimming, every child will be taught skills that allow them to participate in physical activities. 
*   **Equip** our students with future ready skills → Students get to work in teams and strategise and create through play. (Future ready skills - Collaboration and Communication) .
*   **Empower** students to be confident and caring → Our lessons will bring out character traits such as resilience, care and teamwork.

Our PE lessons will aim to achieve the following ABCs for our students. <br>
A - An Active Healthy Lifestyle <br>
B - Build Character <br>
C - Confident Participants

Our Students need to be ready to face the rapidly-changing world while demonstrating resilience, empathy and good decision making. After 6 years at GESPS, our students should achieve the PE goals which are aligned to the curriculum.  

Goal 1: Acquire a range of movement skills to participate in a variety of physical activities.   <br>
Goal 2: Understand and apply movement concepts, principles and strategies in a range of physical activities. <br>
Goal 3: Demonstrate safe practices during physical and daily activities with respect to themselves, others and the environment. <br>
Goal 4: Display positive personal and social behaviour across different experiences. <br>
Goal 5: Acquire and maintain health-enhancing fitness through regular participation in physical activities. <br>
Goal 6: Enjoy and value the benefits of living a physically active and healthy life.

The physical education curriculum, including Programme for Active Learning (PAL), in our school helps pupils to strengthen relationships with their peers, develops discipline and perseverance, and improves self-confidence and self-esteem which is aligned to the Social Emotional Learning model.

What is PAL? <br>
PAL provides diverse educational experiences by merging **classroom learning with outdoor activities** to encourage interest and inquisitiveness among pupils. 3 periods a week will be used to conduct modular activities in Sports and Outdoor Education, and the Performing and Visual Arts. Each class experiences different modules and rotate through the modules across 4 Semesters (across P1 & P2).
