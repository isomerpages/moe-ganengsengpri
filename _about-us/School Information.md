##### School Attendance
  
*   <p align="justify">All students are required to attend school daily. Under the Compulsory Education Act, “a child of compulsory school age shall attend regularly as a pupil at a national primary school.”</p>

*   <p align="justify">The school curriculum, designed to be implemented over 40 weeks, prepares students holistically for subsequent levels. Much of what is taught is progressive and builds on skills and concepts/content previously taught. As such, students should not be absent from school during term time, even if school examination/tests are over.</p>

*   <p align="justify">The school seeks the cooperation of parents/guardians to ensure that their child/ward attends school regularly as this is critical to his/her holistic progress and achievement. Students who fail to attend school on a regular basis will find it challenging to keep up with the curriculum when he/she returns to school. Student absence must be supported with a medical certificate or a parent’s letter for urgent home matters.</p>

##### Permission to Leave School Early
  
*   <p align="justify">Students are not allowed to leave the school on their own during curriculum time and lunch break if they have afternoon activities in school. For the safety of students, parents/guardians have to personally sign for the release of their child/ward at the General Office. If students have to leave school early to attend to personal or family matters, parents/guardians should inform the child’s/ward's Form Teacher in advance.</p>

##### Students’ Safety
  
<p align="justify">Our students’ safety is of utmost importance to the school. To ensure a safe, secure and quiet environment for our students, the school regulates vehicular and human traffic within the school premises.</p>
  

*   <p align="justify">Visitors are advised to make prior appointments with teachers before coming to the school. Otherwise, visitors will be requested to wait at the General Office or return at a later time when the teacher is available.</p>

*   <p align="justify">Visitors are required to collect a visitor’s pass from the security post at the Main gate and proceed to the General Office. Visitors are not allowed to walk into the classrooms or other areas of the school compound without authorisation.</p>

*   <p align="justify">Parents/Guardians can enter the school to purchase of books or uniforms only after dismissal time.</p>
*   <p align="justify">Students should buy their own food from the canteen during recess/lunch. Parents/Guardians are reminded not to enter the school to deliver food to their child/ward. This is to ensure the safety of our students. Instead, students can collect packed food from their parents/guardians at the Main/Side Gate during recess/lunch.</p>

##### Guidelines on Photography/Videography

<p align="justify">Photograph(s) or video image(s) of students and their parents/guardians may be captured during school activities and events such as classroom lessons, CCAs, school camps and concerts. The school may use and publish such photographs and/or video recordings in school publications, the school website, social media channels and other channels.</p>
