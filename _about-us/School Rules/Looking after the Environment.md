*   Clear your plates, bowls and cutlery after eating by returning them to the receptacles provided in the canteen.
*   Observe proper toilet hygiene and keep the toilets clean and dry.
*   Take good care of school property.
*   Report any faulty or broken equipment/devices to your Form Teacher or General Office immediately.

#### Reuse, Reduce & Recycle (3Rs)

In line with the school’s ongoing green movement, the school regularly reminds pupils to do the following:

*   Keep the school litter-free.
*   Dispose of recyclable items into the recycling bins located in the school.
*   Bring old newspapers from home to recycle in school.
*   Recycle materials whenever possible (e.g., use Art materials to decorate the class).
*   Use both sides of writing paper.
*   Switch off all lights, fans and AV equipment (i.e., computer, LCD projector) when leaving the classroom.
*   Turn off all water taps after use.  Do not let water run freely when soaping.
*   Remind each other of good 3Rs practices.
