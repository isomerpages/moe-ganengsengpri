## Safety

#### Safety for All

<p align="justify">The school ensures that its grounds remain as safe, orderly and conducive as possible for learning.&nbsp; Our General Office staff will promptly treat all minor injuries such as cuts and bruises sustained by our pupils.&nbsp; Parents/Guardians can assist by reminding and encouraging their children/ward to play with safety in mind and pay attention to safety rules around the school.&nbsp; Our school regularly reminds pupils to adhere to the following.</p>

*   Always think of your personal safety and the safety of others.
*   Walk. Do not run along the corridors and/or in common open spaces (e.g., canteen, school hall, terrace, staircase landings, parade square).
*   Do not jump or play along the steps of the staircases as you may fall and hurt yourself.
*   Do not play when the ground is wet.
*   Do not step onto the carpark area or bus bay which are only meant for vehicles.&nbsp; At the terrace area, stay behind the yellow barriers at the drop-off point.
*   Pupils must remain in school until the official dismissal time for the day.&nbsp; Do not leave school before dismissal time.
*   Eat and drink in the canteen only.&nbsp; Be careful when carrying hot food items. Running and playing in the canteen may result in injuries as hot food items may spill on you and hurt you and/or your friends.
*   Be careful when handling scissors or penknives during Art &amp; Craft lessons.&nbsp; Always use a pair of scissors with rounded ends.
*   Remind each other of safety practices and habits.
