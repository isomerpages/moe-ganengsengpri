## Radin Mas National Day Dinner Performance by Chinese Dance, Hip-Hop Dance and Circus-in-motion Group

Our Performing Arts Groups were invited to perform at the Radin Mas National Day Dinner on 14 August 2019. The Guest-of-Honour for the event was Minister of State, Ministry of Foreign Affairs & Ministry of Social and Family Development, Sam Tan. This was a great experience for the students as they learnt to build confidence and contribute to the community.

Our students were confident and strived to succeed through the process.

We are proud of our studentsâ€™ performance!
