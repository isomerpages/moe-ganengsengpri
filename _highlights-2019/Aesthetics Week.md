## Aesthetics Week

**Aesthetics Week in Semester 1**

As part of our schoolâ€™s Learning for Life Programme (Aesthetics), we aim to develop confidence in our students through the Visual Arts and Performing Arts.

Our P2 students showed their appreciation to our EAS (non-teaching) staff in their P2 Dance Performance through the collaboration with the Aesthetics and CCE Department.

Our students also wrote Words of Appreciation to our fellow Gespians to show appreciation to one another.

With the Art Exhibition, ArtsJam and P1 & P2 Dance Performance, our students had a very fruitful and enriching experience!
