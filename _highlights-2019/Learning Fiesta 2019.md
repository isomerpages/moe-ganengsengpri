Our school will be holding our GESPS Learning Fiesta and Open House Day on Saturday 6 July 2019 from 8.30am to 12.30pm. It is a time where our parents, students, teachers and guests come together for a day of learning, fun and camaraderie.  

Some of the highlights of the Fiesta include:

*   Lower Primary Fun Day where students and guests will be invited to take part in a myriad of experiential and hands-on learning activities as they visit the learning booths of various disciplines that will provide a better understanding of the school programmes.

*   Showcase of our Learn for Life Programme (Aesthetics) – the distinctive programme of GESPS, where opportunities are created for students to develop in Aesthetics through varied learning experiences. There will be exhibitions and performances which specifically showcase the talents of our students in the area of Visual Arts and Performing Arts. Some examples of the displays are Batik Painting and Wire Sculpturing with Performances by our Band and Choir.
