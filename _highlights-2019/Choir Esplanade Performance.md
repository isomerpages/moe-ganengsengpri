## Choir Esplanade Performance

**Choir’s Performance with Vocal Associates at Esplanade**

The GESPS Choir was invited to perform with Vocal Associates at Esplanade on 02 June 2019. This was a great experience for the students as they learnt to interact and perform with other choristers from different ages.  

The students were confident and strived to succeed through the process.

We are proud of our students’ performance!
