<h4>Uniformed Group Achievements Awards 2024</h4><br>We're proud to celebrate our Uniformed Groups’ attainment of the Frank Cooper Sands Award and Puan Noor Aishah Award for 2024!

This recognition honors our school’s units and their commitment to excellence in both scouting and guiding activities and community service. We couldn't have done it without the enthusiasm and hard work of our teachers, together with the active participation of our cub Scouts and Brownies. We would like to thank our parents for their relentless support too.

Once again, we would like to congratulate our 2 Uniformed Groups in their achievement.

<h4><strong>P6 Overseas Learning Trip</strong></h4>
<p>The school organized an overseas learning trip to Chiang Mai and Hanoi
and it provided our Primary 6 GESPians a fantastic educational experience
where they were given a unique perspective on global learning and cultural
understanding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students had the opportunity to develop 21st Century Competencies, particularly
in the areas of global awareness, cross-cultural communication, and adaptability.
Through the immersive experiences in Thai and Vietnamese culture and language,
students learnt to build respect for diversity, enhance their communication
and collaboration skills, and navigate new environments with confidence
and empathy. This exchange also empowered our students to become active
global citizens, better prepared for the interconnected world of tomorrow.</p>
