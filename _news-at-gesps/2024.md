<h4>International Summit on the Teaching Profession (ISTP)</h4>
<p>GESPS was honoured to be one of the few primary schools selected to host
foreign delegates attending the 14th International Summit on the Teaching
Profession (ISTP). In addition to sharing insights on Singapore’s educational
landscape, our teachers and students showcased key programmes designed

<h4><strong>P6 Overseas Learning Trip</strong></h4>
<p>The school organized an overseas learning trip to Chiang Mai and Hanoi
and it provided our Primary 6 GESPians a fantastic educational experience
where they were given a unique perspective on global learning and cultural
understanding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students had the opportunity to develop 21st Century Competencies, particularly
in the areas of global awareness, cross-cultural communication, and adaptability.
Through the immersive experiences in Thai and Vietnamese culture and language,
students learnt to build respect for diversity, enhance their communication
and collaboration skills, and navigate new environments with confidence
and empathy. This exchange also empowered our students to become active
global citizens, better prepared for the interconnected world of tomorrow.</p>
