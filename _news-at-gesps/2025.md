This being the students’ first SYF artwork, they wanted to do well. They brainstormed on what to focus on and came up with the title of the artwork. It is very heartwarming to see these little ones throwing out ideas and giving their best at all artmaking sessions.

After sharing the SYF theme with them, I was pleasantly surprised that they were able to come up with the relevant idea readily. They displayed good teamwork and great determination to create a top-notch artwork. During every art session, they were able to draw out their own experiences in the various places of interest in Singapore. From their artwork, I was heartened to see that they expressed their love for Singapore and displayed their passion in arts.

<h4>Introducing INSPIRE Mall</h4>
<p>GESPS is proud to unveil our very first ‘INSPIRE’ Mall — an innovative
learning space designed to mirror real-world retail experiences. In this
authentic environment, students engage with Math concepts such as money,
discounts, and percentages through hands-on activities in a simulated supermarket.
The mall also houses Singapore’s first-ever escape room experience specially
created for primary school students. Here, learners apply their knowledge
from Maths, Science, and PE (Health Education) to solve puzzles using educational
technology and “escape” from one of four uniquely themed shop spaces.</p>

<h4><strong>Exchange Programme with Thai Schools</strong></h4>
<p>As the school had visited 2 Thai schools in Chiang Mai last year, this
year the 2 schools – The Prince Royal’s College and Suwannarat Wittayakarn
Primary School – came to Singapore and had a 2-day exchange programme in
Gan Eng Seng Primary School. It was a fantastic opportunity for the visiting
students to immerse themselves in the school culture and expose to a different
education system. These Thai students had the opportunity to attend classes
alongside our students and participate in cultural activities. It had created
a lasting impression in the students of both nations and provided students
with meaningful cross-cultural learning experiences that go beyond the
classroom.</p>

<h4>P1 VIA – My First School</h4>
<p>Our &nbsp;Primary 1 GESPians had &nbsp;the opportunity to interact with
younger peers from My First Skool Through their interaction with the pre-schoolers,
our students were able to show kindness and care towards others and be
role models in behaviour and attitude. It was also a good platform to nurture
empathy, responsibility, and a sense of contribution in our Primary 1 students
by engaging them in age-appropriate acts of care and friendship towards
the pre-schoolers</p>
