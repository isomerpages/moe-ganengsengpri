<h4>Introducing INSPIRE Mall</h4>
<p>GESPS is proud to unveil our very first ‘INSPIRE’ Mall — an innovative
learning space designed to mirror real-world retail experiences. In this
authentic environment, students engage with Math concepts such as money,
discounts, and percentages through hands-on activities in a simulated supermarket.
The mall also houses Singapore’s first-ever escape room experience specially
created for primary school students. Here, learners apply their knowledge
from Maths, Science, and PE (Health Education) to solve puzzles using educational
technology and “escape” from one of four uniquely themed shop spaces.</p>
