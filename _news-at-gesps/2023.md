The Art work, made from Clay and Acrylic Paint, is entitled “Effects of Covid”.  The theme was chosen as all the students had first-hand experiences with Covid. They witnessed changes around them and were deeply affected. Everyone had a story to share. It was a situation they would not want to go through again.
