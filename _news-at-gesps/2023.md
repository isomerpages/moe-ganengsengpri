####     Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) 2023 Art Exhibition

Gan Eng Seng Primary School is proud to announce that one of the Art works created by a group of students (listed in the table below) from the Art Club has been awarded with the Certificate of Recognition at this year’s SYF Art Exhibition.

The Art work, made from Clay and Acrylic Paint, is entitled “Effects of Covid”.  The theme was chosen as all the students had first-hand experiences with Covid. They witnessed changes around them and were deeply affected. Everyone had a story to share. It was a situation they would not want to go through again.
