In Gan Eng Seng Primary School (GESPS), we recognize that students learn best when they are meaningfully engaged be it during lessons in schools or outside the classrooms. The GESPS Signature Programmes are designed to promote meaningful and joyful learning via integrated learning journeys to identified landmarks of Singapore. By the end of their six years of education in GESPS, students would achieve a better understanding of the significance of these landmarks and take pride in Singapore’s achievements. The opportunities to work together in groups as well as independently on projects related to these learning journeys would serve to develop students’ Social-Emotional and 21st Century Competencies. 

  

### P1 – ArtScience Museum

Our P1 _GESPians_ will have the opportunity to visit the iconic cultural attraction that is the world's first art-science museum, featuring major exhibitions that blend art, science, culture, and technology. Interdisciplinary thinking skills and connections are critical to our students in the 21st century. Through their visit to the ArtScience Museum, students can journey into imaginary futures with performance art, interactive exhibitions, and interesting conversations with renowned artists. Designed by renowned architect Moshe Safdie, the lotus-inspired ArtScience Museum has been called “The Welcoming Hand of Singapore” by Mr Sheldon Adelson, the chairman of Las Vegas Corp. Students can admire the architecture of the building that is evocative of a lotus flower and allows for the harvesting of rainwater which is used sustainably by the museum.
