**For the Love of the Arts**

The school believes that every student has an innate artistic ability and talent in their own unique ways. The Learning for Life Programme (LLP) in Aesthetics aims to  cultivate these artistic abilities and potential within our students that will inspire the love and pursuit in the Arts.  Guided by the 3E (Exposure, Experience, Excellence) Approach, the school strives to provide learning opportunities and platforms to achieve the desired student outcomes.

**Exposure**<br>
â€¢	To create an awareness and appreciation for the Arts through the assembly programme and level-based curriculum lessons

The LLP outcomes&nbsp;<br>
1 \.  Students appreciate the unity and diversity of Art forms in a multicultural society.&nbsp;<br>
2 \.  Students develop social and emotional competencies through their engagement in Arts.&nbsp;

The school programmes are classified under Tier One or Two depending on the level of engagement. Each child will embark on different activities throughout their 6 years at GESPS with our aim to help each student achieve those outcomes.
