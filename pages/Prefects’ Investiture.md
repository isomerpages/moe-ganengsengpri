The investiture this year was a ceremony of ‘many firsts’. The school’s first elected Head Prefect, Andrea Chua was introduced to the school. The new prefect logo as well as the organisational charge of the new prefectorial board were also introduced to the students for the first time.

The school would like to thank the parents for gracing the occasion and supporting their children in their leadership pursuit. We certainly hope that the prefects will be good role models and live out the school values.
