## SYF 2017 Celebrations@Esplanade

The SYF 2017 Celebrations, themed ‘Youth HeARTS!’, is an annual arts festival organised by MOE. The festival provides students with an opportunity to showcase their talents and share their love for the arts through creating and showcasing works, as well as responding to one another’s works. One of the key performance platforms at the SYF 2017 Celebrations is “Melodies”, an indoor music concert that was held at the Esplanade Concourse from 30 June to 2 July. Our pupils from the GESPS choir were invited to the event, where they performed three pieces titled “The Rainbow”, “One Song” and “Turkey in the Straw”. Well done, GESPSians!
