## Choir’s performance for the NLB opening at Vivocity

The GESPS Choir was invited to perform at the National Library Board Vivocity Opening Ceremony on 12 Jan 2019. The Guest-of Honour of the event was Minister for Communications and Information S. Iswaran.

The students were confident and strived to succeed through the process.

We are proud of our students’ performance!
