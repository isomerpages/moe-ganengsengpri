## ICT Intergenerational Bootcamp 2017

GESPS, in collaboration with IMDA and Stag Match, held an ICT Intergenerational Bootcamp for 24 senior citizens on Tuesday 5 September 2017. The session, which was conducted in English and Chinese, saw each senior citizen being paired with a GESPian who guided them through the basics of using the iPad. The seniors had a fruitful session and thoroughly enjoyed it. Our GESPians displayed confidence and communicated well with the elderly. They were also elated to be selected for the session and gained new knowledge through the process.
