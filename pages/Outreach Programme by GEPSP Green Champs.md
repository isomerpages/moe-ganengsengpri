## Outreach Programme by GEPSP Green Champs

On 13 August 2019, a group of our _GESPians_ visited the Carpe Diem Starlets Sparkle Preschool at Jalan Bukit Merah to educate the preschoolers on caring for the environment. Our _GESPians_ engaged the preschool students in meaningful activities to raise their awareness on the 3Rs (Reduce, Reuse and Recycle). The preschoolers received various tips, e.g. sorting of recyclable items. Through the interaction, our _GESPians_ gained more confidence and learned to be patient when engaging the little ones.
