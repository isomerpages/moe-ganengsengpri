## VIA Programmes

The Values-in-Action (VIA) for Primary One students adopts the theme of ‘Uniquely Me’. Forming strategic partnerships with SMRT, our students volunteered their time at Redhill MRT station, which is about 5 minutes’ walk away from the school.

Prior to the VIA activity, the Primary One students were taught how little acts of kindness would brighten up someone’s day. Teachers also shared with the students some common greetings in different languages. With “confidence” being one of the school’s character traits, students learnt to present and express themselves confidently to members of the public. On the day of the activity, our little GESPians would approach and greet passers-by with a big smile as well as present them with their handmade gifts. The school hopes that through the VIA activity, our Primary One students would develop into confident individuals, and at the same time, bring cheers to the commuters.

For Primary Five, the school adopts the level theme of ‘My Community, My Duty’. Like their younger Primary One schoolmates, our Primary 5 students also volunteered their time at Redhill MRT station as Service Ambassadors. Prior to the day of the VIA activity, SMRT representatives would conduct short training to familiarise the students to their roles. Thereafter, these service ambassadors would serve the community with the skills learnt. Their area of responsibilities included helping commuters with directions, lending a hand at the ticketing machines and ensuring that the elderly and those in need are given priority to use the lifts.

The school hopes that through the VIA activities planned, our Primary 5 GESPians will develop into responsible individuals who will contribute actively towards the community.
