## P5 HCL Learning Journey to Sun Yat Sen Nanyang Memorial Hall

<img src="/images/Sun Yat Sen Memorial Hall (Group).jpg" style="width:85%">

Our P5 students were invited by Sun Yat Sen Memorial Hall (http://sysnmh.org.sg/en/about-us/overview) to rewrite the caption of selected artefacts in the permanent galleries. Their simplified captions are targeted at young visitors and will be on display near the artefacts during the Childrenâ€™s Seasons from mid-June to July 2018. The is the first of such collaboration with a National Heritage and Memorial site and Gan Eng Seng Primary School is honored to be involved.
