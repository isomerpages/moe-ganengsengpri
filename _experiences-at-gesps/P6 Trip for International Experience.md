<h5>P6 - Trip for International Experience to Thailand </h5><p>To better prepare our GESPians to be global citizens of today’s world, our school is organising an overseas school immersion programme to Thailand  for our Primary 6 students. Through this International Experience, our GESPians will develop essential 21st Century competencies such as global awareness and cross-cultural skills. &nbsp;Our school has collaborated with local schools there and our GESPians will attend lessons with local students to gain different schooling experience. They will also visit cultural sites where they will learn the rich history and heritage of these ASEAN countries. Through this immersive learning experience, our GESPians will be able to gain greater appreciation for cultural&nbsp;diversity and differences, as well as learn a 3rd language which is part of our school’s distinctive programme</p>
