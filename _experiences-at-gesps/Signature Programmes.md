<p>In Gan Eng Seng Primary School (GESPS), we recognize that students learn best when they are meaningfully engaged be it during lessons in schools or outside the classrooms. The GESPS Signature Programmes are designed to promote meaningful and joyful learning via integrated learning journeys to identified landmarks of Singapore. By the end of their six years of education in GESPS, students would achieve a better understanding of the significance of these landmarks and take pride in Singapore’s achievements. The opportunities to work together in groups as well as independently on projects related to these learning journeys would serve to develop students’ Social-Emotional and 21st Century Competencies.&nbsp;</p><h5>P1 – ArtScience Museum</h5><p>Our P1 GESPians will have the opportunity to visit the iconic cultural attraction that is the world's first art-science museum, featuring major exhibitions that blend art, science, culture, and technology. Interdisciplinary thinking skills and connections&nbsp;are critical&nbsp;to our students in the 21st&nbsp;century. Through their visit to the ArtScience Museum, students can journey into imaginary futures with performance art, interactive exhibitions, and interesting conversations with renowned artists. Designed by renowned architect Moshe Safdie, the lotus-inspired ArtScience Museum has been called “The Welcoming Hand of Singapore” by Mr Sheldon Adelson, the chairman of Las Vegas Corp. Students can admire the architecture of the building that is evocative of a lotus flower and allows for the harvesting of rainwater which is used sustainably by the museum.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width:75%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/sp1.png"></div><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width:75%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/sp2.png"></div><h5>P2 – Marina Barrage</h5><p>Our P2 GESPIANs will find it amazing how the Marina Barrage was created to boost Singapore’s water supply and prevent flooding while offering a venue for water-based recreational activities in the heart of the city. The award winning barrage is considered an engineering marvel because of its magnitude and complexity. It is a shining example of Singapore’s commitment to environmental and water sustainability with its roof garden, solar panels, rainwater collection system and many other green features incorporated in the building. As our students find out how high quality water is processed and discover more about Singapore’s efforts to be environmentally friendly and go green, our students will also learn how they can play their part in keeping Singapore’s waterways clean. GESPians will also see Singapore in a different light after taking in the panoramic view of Singapore’s cityscape, showcasing many Singapore iconic structures, from the rooftop of Marina Barrage.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width:75%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/sp3.png"></div><h5>P3 – S.E.A. Aquarium</h5><p>P3 GESPians will be awed by the diversity of marine wildlife and the fascinating facts on the 100,000 marine animals from 800 different species and 50 habitats from across the globe that has S.E.A. Aquarium as their new home. With an expedition to this marine home, our students will get to experience the joy of seeing in real life what they had only seen in books or the television such as the poison arrow frog, epaulette shark, native knobbly sea star, the colourful plant-like animals that are coral frags and many more. Learning extends beyond the textbook as students also gain an understanding of the meaning of the words ‘vulnerable’ and ‘threatened’ and thus the importance of protecting marine animals through the eye-catching educational displays on marine conservation. We hope to inspire our students to become ambassadors of positive change for marine conservation.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width:75%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/sp4.png"></div><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width:75%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/sp5.png"></div><h5>P4 - KidZania</h5><p>The P4 students will enter the interactive city of KidZania as part of their Signature Programme. It combines inspiration, fun and learning through realistic role-play as they explore different careers and the concept of managing money. The experiences are designed to empower students and give them confidence to be their best selves.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width:75%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/P4_SP.jpg"></div>

<h5>P5 – Gardens by the Bay</h5><p>The exciting outdoor learning experience to the Gardens by the Bay will allow our P5 GESPians learn beyond the classroom and have first-hand experience to see how different conservation strategies are applied in real life context. While learning about how the two cooled conservatories (Flower Dome and Cloud Forest) apply a set of advanced, cutting-edge technologies for energy-efficient solutions in cooling, students will get to experience how it feels like to be in a greenhouse, aiding them in their understanding of energy sustainability strategies. In addition, as climate change is one of the key global problems currently faced, this learning journey will give our students an awareness of climate change as one of the key global problems currently faced and how Singapore has played its part in caring for the environment and conserving resources. We wish to inspire our students to be actively engaged in conservation by adopting energy-saving practices in their daily life.</p>

<h5>P6 Trip for International Experience to Thailand and Vietnam</h5><p>To better prepare our GESPians to be global citizens of today’s world, our school is organising an overseas school immersion programme to Thailand or Vietnam for our Primary 6 students. Through this International Experience, our GESPians will develop essential 21st Century competencies such as global awareness and cross-cultural skills. &nbsp;Our school has collaborated with local schools there and our GESPians will attend lessons with local students to gain different schooling experience. They will also visit cultural sites where they will learn the rich history and heritage of these ASEAN countries. Through this immersive learning experience, our GESPians will be able to gain greater appreciation for cultural&nbsp;diversity and differences, as well as learn a 3rd language which is part of our school’s distinctive programme</p>
