#### Learning for Life Programme (LLP)

##### For the Love of the Arts
<p align="justify">The school believes that every student has an innate artistic ability and talent in their own unique ways. The Learning for Life Programme (LLP) in Aesthetics aims to  cultivate these artistic abilities and potential within our students that will inspire the love and pursuit in the Arts. Guided by the 3E (Exposure, Experience, Excellence) Approach, the school strives to provide learning opportunities and platforms to achieve the desired student outcomes.</p>

##### Exposure<br>
•	Through the assembly programme and level-based curriculum lessons, students gain a greater awareness and appreciation for the Arts as they are exposed to different art forms.

##### Experience<br>
•	Students get to experience the Arts more intimately as they engage in the Arts through authentic learning and sensory experiences such as Learning Journeys to Art Venues and Arts-based events and activities such as Aesthetics Week and Musical Production.
