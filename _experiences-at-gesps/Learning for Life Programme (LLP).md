#### Learning for Life Programme (LLP) @GESPS

<u>Developing Learners with G.R.I.T (Gumption, Resilience. Inclusiveness. Trustworthiness) through Sports and Outdoor Education</u>

In line with our school’s vision of “Developing Learners with Grit” and our INSPIRE Values, we are committed to nurturing students who embody G.R.I.T- Gumption, Resilience, Inclusiveness, and Trustworthiness - through various tiered programmes for Sports and Outdoor Education (OE) programmes by the end of Primary Six:

**Gumption** – Our students demonstrate determination and courage in the face of challenges.<br>
**Resilience** – They develop the ability to recover quickly from difficulties and adapt to changing circumstances.<br>
**Inclusiveness** – They learn to make people from all backgrounds, ages and abilities feel welcome, respected and valued.<br>
**Trustworthiness** – Our students become reliable and responsible individuals who can be depended upon.<br>

These attributes are fostered through an Experiential Learning and Place-Responsive Approach, where teachers play a crucial role in facilitating learning that connects students with their community and enhances civic literacy.&nbsp; To ensure the success of these programmes, professional development is prioritized, equipping teachers with the competencies needed to intentionally design and implement our LLP to develop the E21CC in students.&nbsp;

**Tier 1** **Programmes**
*  Recess play sports activities
*  Orientation programmes for P3 to P5 students which encompass outdoor learning activities
*  Level wide sports competitions
