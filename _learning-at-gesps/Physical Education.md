#### Learning Physical Education @GESPS

As part of the school’s overall effort towards holistic learning, a child’s physical education at Gan Eng Seng Primary is guided by the 3 E approach. Our focus on developing the child in the physical domain would be defined by the following;

*   **Embrace**&nbsp;different talents and abilities  
    Through the teaching of 3 Learning Areas, every child will be taught skills that allow them to participate in physical activities, have the necessary movement competencies and find joy in learning. 
		 
* **Equip** our students with future ready skills
Students get to work in teams and strategise and create through play. (e.g. Future ready skills - Collaboration and Communication).

* **Empower** students to be confident and caring
Our lessons will bring out character traits such as resilience, care and teamwork. They will also provide students the knowledge to lead active healthy lifestyles and safety mindset in whatever they do.

The PE department aims to provide the skills required for students to pursue a lifetime of active and healthy living.

By the end of 6 years, we would like our *GESPians* to demonstrate the following:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • engage in physical activities of interest regularly and limit sedentary time<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • spend time outdoors and enjoy nature responsibly<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • have a balanced diet and often choose healthier options<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • rest and sleep sufficiently<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • practice personal hygiene<br>

The physical education curriculum, including Programme for Active Learning (PAL), in our school helps pupils to strengthen relationships with their peers, develops discipline and perseverance, and improves self-confidence and self-esteem which is aligned to the Social Emotional Learning model.

  

**What is PAL?&nbsp;**<br>
PAL provides diverse educational experiences by merging&nbsp;**classroom learning with outdoor activities**&nbsp;to encourage interest and inquisitiveness among pupils. 4 periods a week will be used to conduct modular activities in Sports and Outdoor Education, and the Performing and Visual Arts. Each class experiences different modules and rotate through the modules across 4 Semesters (across P1 &amp; P2).
