#### Educational Technology @GESPS

The Educational Technology (EdTech) Department strives to develop future-ready digital learners and nurture our students to become responsible users of technology.

With a dedicated commitment to harnessing technology as a powerful enabler, we aim to create an enriching learning experience for our students. Technology is meaningfully integrated into the curriculum through immersive online resources and collaborative learning platforms, fostering a student-centric ecosystem that promotes adaptability, critical thinking, and digital literacy while nurturing responsible and ethical use of technology. This ensures that students are well-prepared with the skills and knowledge needed to thrive in the digital age.

One of the key online learning portals supporting students throughout their educational journey at GESPS is the Student Learning Space (SLS).

We also aim to equip our teachers with the relevant EdTech knowledge through professional development opportunities, enabling them to explore and implement new learning possibilities made possible by digital technologies.

#### Empowering Digital Learners @GESPS

At GESPS, students progressively develop digital skills across the four components of the “Find, Think, Apply, Create” framework from MOE’s National Digital Literacy Programme, integrating technology into various subjects.

Additionally, students at GESPS are exposed to coding and computational thinking skills through collaboration with the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) for the Primary 6 Code for Fun Programme. This post-PSLE activity introduces students to fundamental computational thinking and basic coding concepts. The partnership with IMDA enriches the overall educational experience and has garnered positive feedback from students, further demonstrating the school's commitment to fostering confident, critical, and responsible users of digital technologies for information, communication, and problem-solving.
