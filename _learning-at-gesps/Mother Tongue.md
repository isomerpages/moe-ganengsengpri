#### Learning Mother Tongue @GESPS

In GESPS, the Mother Tongue Languages (MTL) Department is dedicated to crafting meaningful lessons and programmes that foster genuine and enjoyable learning experiences for our students. Our goal is to cultivate a love for learning and build confidence in language proficiency, while instilling an appreciation for their cultural heritage and traditions, alongside essential 21st century skills.

Students develop essential communication abilities encompassing listening, speaking, reading, and writing, both in informal conversations and formal discourse. Teachers play a pivotal role in guiding students to comprehend and value cultural materials, thereby enhancing their global and cultural awareness. Furthermore, the department actively creates opportunities for students to apply and refine their language skills in real-world contexts beyond the confines of the classroom.
  

#### Embracing all Students – Curriculum Customisation

At GESPS, we embrace students of diverse abilities by offering a range of programs tailored to their individual needs. The Mother Tongue Languages (MTL) Department provides various specialized programs, including:

Higher Mother Tongue Languages (P3-P6):

This programme is designed for students who demonstrate exceptional proficiency in their Mother Tongue Language (MTL). It begins at the end of P2 and aims to further enhance students' linguistic abilities and fluency.

Support Programmes:

The Mother Tongue Support Programme (MTSP) is a two-year initiative specifically designed to support students who require additional assistance in developing their proficiency in MTL. Teachers within this programme are equipped with diverse teaching strategies and resources to effectively engage students and elevate their proficiency levels by the end of P4. Additionally, for students needing further support, the department offers a remediation programme targeted at selected individuals.

These programmes reflect our commitment to catering to the unique learning needs of all our students at GESPS.

3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Signature Programme – Conversational Chinese and Malay Language

  
Conversational Chinese and Malay (CCM) Programme is introduced as a Signature Programme in GESPS to encourage the connection between the diverse ethnic groups in the school for P3 to P6 students. Students&nbsp; are encouraged to learn basic conversational Chinese or Malay so that they will be able to hold a simple conversation in authentic situations with a native Chinese or Malay speaker. The ability to converse in another Mother Tongue language helps strengthen racial harmony.
