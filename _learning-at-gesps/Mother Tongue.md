#### Learning Mother Tongue @GESPS

<p align="justify">In GESPS, the Mother Tongue Languages (MTL) Department is dedicated to crafting meaningful lessons and programmes that foster genuine and enjoyable learning experiences for our students. Our goal is to cultivate a love for learning and build confidence in language proficiency, while instilling an appreciation for their cultural heritage and traditions, alongside essential 21st century skills.</p>

<p align="justify">Students develop essential communication abilities encompassing listening, speaking, reading, and writing, both in informal conversations and formal discourse. Teachers play a pivotal role in guiding students to comprehend and value cultural materials, thereby enhancing their global and cultural awareness. Furthermore, the department actively creates opportunities for students to apply and refine their language skills in real-world contexts beyond the confines of the classroom.</p>
  

#### Embracing all Students – Curriculum Customisation

###### **3. Conversational Chinese, Malay &amp; Tamil Programme**
  
<p align="justify">Conversational Chinese and Malay (CCM) and Conversational Tamil (CT) Programmes are conducted as a Signature Programme in GESPS to encourage the connection between the diverse ethnic groups in the school for P3 to P6 students. Students are encouraged to learn basic conversational Chinese, Malay and Tamil so that they will be able to hold a simple conversation in authentic situations with native speakers. The ability to converse in another Mother Tongue language helps strengthen racial harmony and exposes the students to learning of a 3rd language.</p>
