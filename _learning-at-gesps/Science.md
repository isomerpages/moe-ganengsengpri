#### Learning Science @GESPS

The Science department strives to nurture GESPians with a passion for Science who are active eco stewards of their environment. GESPians are encouraged to take ownership of their own learning through inquiry, which is characterised by the degree of responsibility they have in posing and responding to questions, designing investigations, and evaluating and communicating their learning. Through this, GESPians develop their scientific inquiry and reasoning skills, and become more confident communicators who are passionate about learning.

 

Beyond the classroom, GESPians are empowered with experiences as an inquirer who would be able to enjoy Science and value Science as an important tool to help them explore the natural and physical world. These experiences include the P1 and P2 Science Exploration Day, Level Signature Programmes, and other Special Programmes offered by the department.


#### Embracing all Students – Curriculum Customisation
The school customises the teaching of Science to meet the learning needs of all students in the classroom and beyond the classroom.  Aligned with the school’s talent development framework, the department offers provisions for students to develop their interests and talents in Science at three levels, namely, Exposure, Experience and Excellence.

Provisions at the ‘Exposure’ level are for all students and aim to expose students to new interests and allow them to learn and strengthen foundational skills and 21st century competencies. Teachers use a variety of strategies to facilitate engaging and meaningful learning experiences in Science to support students’ learning. These include the use of OCA (What do I Observe? What is the Concept? How do I Apply?) to guide students in their scientific reasoning and communication of ideas, investigative projects, experiments as well as outdoor hands-on exploration activities. Where relevant, appropriate technology is also used to enhance students’ learning of science concepts and boost the joy of learning. 

Provisions at the ‘Experience’ level are voluntary and provided for students to explore and verify their interests and talents. These include in-class investigative projects and self-directed learning opportunities via the Student Learning Space.

Provisions at the ‘Excellence’ level aim to provide advanced learning opportunities for students who are ready for and motivated by challenging experiences. These include the Special Programmes offered by the department, such as&nbsp; the Science Buskers Programme.

#### Eco Stewardship

Systems are also put in place to further model and anchor environmental protection among our staff – For instance, staff are encouraged to practice double-sided photocopying and use their own cutlery or lunchbox during meals instead of using the plastic utensils and styrofoam boxes.&nbsp;

Through these, the school aims to instill in our&nbsp;_GESPians_&nbsp;and staff the desire and passion to care for our living environment by adopting an eco-friendly lifestyle.

#### Fostering the Joy of Learning – Special Programmes

The school offers a range of programmes to enthuse and excite students about science.&nbsp;

**1)**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**P1 and P2 Science Exploration Day**

While our GESPians only begin their Science lessons in Primary 3, Primary 1 and 2 GESPians are also introduced to the science behind magnets and flight as part of the P1 and P2 Science Exploration Day through hands-on activities.&nbsp;

**2)**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Science Enrichment Programme**

The Science Enrichment Programme provides selected Primary 5 students with the opportunity to engage with science topics through hands-on activities and seeks to strengthen their interest in Science.&nbsp;

**3)**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Excellence 2000 (E2K Science) Programme**

The E2K Science Programme offers opportunities for selected students to engage in scientific investigations to discover and deepen their understanding of advanced science concepts through an inquiry approach.&nbsp;

**4)**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Science Buskers Programme**

The Science Buskers Programme aims to develop students’ ability to communicate scientifically in a creative manner. Students will create and present a ‘show-and-tell’ on a science topic of their choice during the Singapore Science Buskers competition.
