## FAQs

#### (A) Student Admission

**Returning Singaporeans**

**Q1: What does MOE mean by 'Returning Singaporean children'?**<br>
Returning Singaporean children are Singapore Citizens or Singapore Permanent Residents children who are:  
*   going overseas to live and study;
*   currently living and studying overseas; or
*   returning home having lived and studied overseas.

**Q2: Is there a timeframe for school admission for Returning Singaporean?**<br>
Parents of Returning Singaporean children may admit their child to primary schools at any time during the year. However, parents are encouraged to seek admission in the first half of the year, as the school year is from January to November each year.

**Q3: What are the options for school admission for Returning Singaporean?**<br>
In recognition of the different needs of Returning Singaporeans, MOE has provided several options for school admission. Returning Singaporeans can choose one or more options based on their individual needs.  
 
i. P1 Registration - If your child is due to enter Primary One, you are encouraged to register your child while abroad during the Primary One Registration Exercise (usually held from July to September in the preceding year). Upon obtaining a place and you are still not due to return to Singapore in time for your child to start Primary One, you can apply to keep the place for your child under the Leave of Absence (LOA) Scheme at the registered school.<br>
ii. Apply directly to your preferred schools - Returning Singaporeans may approach schools directly to seek admission. Generally, you may do so throughout the year, subject to school operations and/or examination periods.<br>
iii. Approach MOE for assistance

**Leave of Absence**

**Q1: What is Leave of Absence (LOA)?**<br>
In support of Singapore's internationalisation efforts, MOE has implemented a Leave of Absence (LOA) Scheme to facilitate the re-admission of children who accompany their parents on overseas postings upon their return. If your child is granted LOA, he/she will continue to be registered as a student of the school. Upon your return, your child can then be re-admitted to his/her former school directly. More details can be found on MOE's <br>website: [https://www.moe.gov.sg/admissions/returning-singaporeans/support-schemes](https://www.moe.gov.sg/admissions/returning-singaporeans/support-schemes). **PAGE NOT FOUND**

**Q5: What will happen if my child withdraw from a programme paid by Edusave?**<br>
Schools may process a refund to the child's Edusave account if there is legitimate reason for the withdrawal (e.g. due to medical reasons). For students who withdraw from the programme at the last minute or are absent without a valid reason, there is strictly no refund.
