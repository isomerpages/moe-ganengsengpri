**5. Will email accounts be provisioned for all students?**  
<p align="justify">No. To ensure students are adequately protected from cyber threats such as engagements from strangers and cyber bullying, the email account will <b>NOT</b> be provisioned for P1, P2 and P3 students.</p>
	
<p align="justify">Email accounts for P4, P5 and P6 will be provisioned but they can only send or receive emails internally within all MOE domains such as <u>moe.edu.sg</u>, <u>students.edu.sg</u>, <u>schools.gov.sg</u> and <u>moe.gov.sg</u>. This is to limit the cyber wellness exposure such as strangers writing to the students.</p>
	
**6. Can my child in P4, P5 or P6 use this email to sign up or install any web-based or mobile applications?**  
<p align="justify">No. Students will <b>NOT</b> be able to use this email to sign up or install any web-based or mobile applications as they wonâ€™t be able to receive emails outside MOE domains as stated in the point above.</p>

<p align="justify">As a good practice, students should always consult their parents or teachers before installing any applications or games on their devices. </p>
