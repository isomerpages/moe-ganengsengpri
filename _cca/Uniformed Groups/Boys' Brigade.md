The Boys’ Brigade is an Uniformed Group Co-Curricular Activity for boys from primary 3 to primary 6. It aims to:

*   Develop and grow our boys in moral character
*   Train our boys to become loyal and responsible citizens
*   Promote physical fitness among our boys
*   Develop our boys’ leadership skills

<p align="justify">Through weekly parades, enriching activities, and outings, our boys participate in a wide range of activities and volunteer work that holistically nurtures them and teaches them the values of obedience, reverence, discipline, and self-respect.</p>
