The Boys’ Brigade is an Uniformed Group Co-Curricular Activity for boys from primary 3 to primary 5. It aims to:

*   help our boys develop and grow in moral character
*   train our boys to become loyal and responsible citizens
*   promote physical fitness amongst our boys
*   develop our boys’ leadership

Through the weekly parades, enriching activities and outings, our boys go through a wide range of activities and volunteer work that holistically nurtures them and teaches them the habits of obedience, reverence, discipline and self-respect.
