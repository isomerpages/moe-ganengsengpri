Brownies is a Co-Curricular Activity (CCA) for girls who are interested in experiencing what it is like being in an Uniformed Group CCA. The Brownies’ motto, “Lend a Hand”, guides our Brownies to become helpful and compassionate girls who give back to society. Through fun and instructional indoor and outdoor activities, students learn values, build self-confidence, learn practical and life skills and, in the process, develop strong friendships.
