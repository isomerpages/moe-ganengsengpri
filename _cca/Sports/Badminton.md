<p align="justify">Badminton Co-Curricular Activity (CCA) promotes an active and healthy lifestyle amongst our students. There is a recreational group for students who just want to learn and enjoy the game and a competitive group where students undergo a more rigorous training to develop their skills and stamina for competitions. The aim of the CCA is to see our badminton members demonstrate the spirit of fair play, teamwork and sportsmanship on and off the court.</p>
