Floorball will be a newly introduced CCA in 2021.!
  
Floorball is a fast paced and exciting invasion court game where players use floorball sticks to score goals into a goal. You can play as offence, defence or Goalkeeper!

We are looking for P3, P4 and P5 boys and girls to train and represent Gan Eng Seng Primary at the National Schools Games next year. If you like to run and play team sports, or just to make new friends, Floorball is the sport for you.
