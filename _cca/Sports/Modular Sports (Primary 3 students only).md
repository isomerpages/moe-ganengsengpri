<p>At GESPS, our Modular Sports CCA programme is designed to provide Primary
3 students with exposure to a variety of sports, helping them discover
their interests and strengths. Students enrolled in the Modular Sports
CCA will have the opportunity to experience <strong>four key sports offered by the school: Badminton, Basketball, Floorball and Football</strong>.</p>
<p>Under the guidance of experienced coaches, students will rotate through
each sport over an 6-week period, developing foundational skills and knowledge.
This structured rotation ensures that every student gains hands-on experience
in all four sports before progressing further.</p>
<p>At the end of Primary 3, students will transition into a main sports CCA
from Primary 4 to Primary 6. Students are encouraged to express their interest
in a preferred sport at the end of Primary 3, however allocation to a specific
sports CCA will depend on availability to ensure optimal learning opportunities
for all participants.</p>
<p>The Modular Sports CCA at GESPS aims to nurture well-rounded athletes
and foster a love for physical activity, teamwork, and sportsmanship from
an early age. We look forward to supporting your child on their sporting
journey!</p>
