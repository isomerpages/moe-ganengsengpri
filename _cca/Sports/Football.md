<p align="justify">As part of our efforts towards a holistic education for our students, the Co-Curricular Activity, Football, was introduced in Gan Eng Seng Primary School in 2002, under the leadership of a team of passionate and dedicated teachers. Nicknamed ‘The Gryphons’, our footballers are tenacious but respectable gentlemen, who represent and exemplify our GESPS School Values both on and off the field. Together with our caring and professional FAS qualified Coach, we strive to build on our achievements and attain greater heights every year.</p>
