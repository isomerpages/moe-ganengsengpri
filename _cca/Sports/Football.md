<p>CCAs provide students with a platform to discover their interests and
talents, and progressively develop CCA-specific knowledge, skills, values
and attitudes. CCAs also offer excellent platforms for students to develop
character, learn values and develop social-emotional competencies. It is
a common space for social interaction and the formation of friendships
amongst students of diverse backgrounds.</p>
<p>In certain circumstances, schools may consider inter-school partnerships
through leveraging on common a CCA to share resources due to dwindling
enrolment.</p>
<p>In 2023, Gan Eng Seng Primary School embarked on this collaboration with
River Valley Primary School. Our 2023 GESP/RV programme was designed to
allow meaningful interactions amongst players from our two schools, the
objective was to facilitate students from both schools to get to know each
other, train together, experience challenges and overcome them together.
The coaches and teachers in charge facilitated pre- and post-activities
to guide learning so that the combined experiences would achieve the intended
objective of positive interaction. This year, our seniors formed 2 teams
with River Valley Primary School. They have completed the matches and have
enjoyed the experience.</p>
