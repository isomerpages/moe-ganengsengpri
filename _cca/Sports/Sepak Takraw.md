Sepak Takraw Club is our newest addition to our Sports CCA It is a sport that combines many different kicks, spikes, and serves. These range from basic ones that most beginners would be able to pick up easily, to the more acrobatic kinds that require long periods of training and practice to execute flawlessly. While it is quite similar to footvolley, the use of a rattan ball further requires our players to demonstrate greater control of their strength and flexibility.

Although the school has only started Sepak Takraw in 2019, our Sepak Takraw boys have already done us proud as they competed in the National School Games (2019) with the Junior Boys clinching the 3rd Place in the Tier 2 Junior Division Boys Competition.
