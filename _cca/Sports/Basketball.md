## Basketball

**Teacher 1 I/C:** **[Mr Goh Zhao Xiong](mailto:goh_zhao_xiong@schools.gov.sg)** <br>

Our Basketball players are trained by their experienced instructors the skills to shoot, pass, dribble and rebound and their passion for the game and their dedication to mastering these skills can be seen when they play during training sessions and inter-school competitions. Being in a Sports Co-Curricular Activity also teaches our students discipline, resilience and sportsmanship. Having a common interest in Basketball and going through the joys and woes of training and competitions have enabled our players develop from being just being team mates to true friends.
