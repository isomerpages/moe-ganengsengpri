<p align="justify">The Indian Dance Co-Curricular Activity (CCA) aims to develop in our students an appreciation for different forms of Indian dance and instill in them a sense of commitment and discipline. Indian Dance CCA provides opportunities for students to experience collaborative work during practices and performances. The members of the Indian Dance are from various ethnic groups but dance unifies all of them as our CCA focuses on contemporary and Indian folk dance. Our dancers are given several platforms within and outside the school to showcase their talents and this has helped them to become confident individuals.</p>
