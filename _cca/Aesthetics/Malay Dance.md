The members of the Malay Dance Co-Curricular Activity (CCA) are P3 to P6 students and most of them usually start off with no dance background. However, the weekly sessions conducted by the school’s experienced instructor and the students’ diligence and resilience have enabled them to learn various dance techniques which they demonstrate at various platforms arranged by the school such as Excellers’ Day and The Learning Fiesta. A CCA of diversity, Malay Dance welcomes all races and gender. Students in the Malay Dance participate in every Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation and received the Certificate of Accomplishment in 2018.
