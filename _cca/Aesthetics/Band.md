<p align="justify">GESPS Brass Band has been performing in various school events as well as community events to share their love for music. Band members meet up to twice weekly to learn how to play on their own instrument and progress in the learning of music. Our Brass Band was awarded the Certificate of Accomplishment at the recent 2024 Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation.</p>
