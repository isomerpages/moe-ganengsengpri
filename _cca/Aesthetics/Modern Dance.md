Modern Dance CCA specialises in Contemporary Dance and it aims to nurture and develop students to become all-rounded dance performers. In this CCA, the students will learn to appreciate the different dance forms pertaining to Contemporary Dance. Students will understand that a choreographed dance is a creation of movements to match a dancerâ€™s feelings and purpose. They will be given the opportunities to express their feelings and creativity through movement and rhythm during practices or performances.

2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To enable students to learn the techniques of Contemporary Dance

3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To enable students to learn values of teamwork, discipline and perseverance

4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To encourage all dancers to strive for excellence and enjoy the journey along the way.
