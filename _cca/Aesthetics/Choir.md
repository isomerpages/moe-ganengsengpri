<p align="justify">More than 60 Choir members aged nine to twelve gather weekly to experience the joy of singing. Our Choir performs regularly at school events and at functions on the invitation of the Ministry of Education and other organizations. Through performances and exposure to the local and international choral scene, our young choristers develop a deep love for singing and gain invaluable training in musicianship, self-discipline, confidence, poise and teamwork.</p>
