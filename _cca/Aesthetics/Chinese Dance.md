<p align="justify">In addition to performances at school events, our talented students also participate in the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation and received the Distinction award in 2016 and Accomplishment awards in 2014 and 2018. To give our students more exposure to develop their self-confidence, life skills and dance skills, they will be given opportunities to participate at community events.</p>
