Green Explorer Club aims to cultivate an appreciation and interest in the environment by providing members with opportunities to learn and explore science and the environment around them. Some of the topics covered include: Food Sustainability, Alternative Farming Methods, Food Wastage, Conservation and 3Rs – Reuse, Reduce &amp; Recycle.&nbsp;

During the CCA sessions, members get the chance to grow vegetables via hydroponics and do planting at our school’s vertical farm. Through various hands-on activities, research, investigation, learning journeys as well as collaboration with peers, members will become more aware of their impact on the environment and hence develop a sense of responsibility to care for the environment.
