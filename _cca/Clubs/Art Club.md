<p align="justify">The Art Club is a Co-Curricular Activity that unleashes our studentsâ€™ creativity. Our students are exposed to different art forms and media and learn artistic skills in areas such as:  </p>
  
1 \.  Painting / blending of colours using oil pastels<br>
2 \.  Paper mache<br>
3 \.  Paper quilling<br>
4 \.  Batik painting<br>
5 \.  Abstract drawing

<p align="justify">Our students develop their self-confidence and learn about team work when they participate in the Singapore Youth Festival Competition. Collaborative work allows the students to maximise their strengths and create chances to learn from their peers. The largest art project which the Art Club members have embarked on was the Anti Drug Competition which also involved a school-wide participation to create responses on how to stay drug free and healthy.</p>
