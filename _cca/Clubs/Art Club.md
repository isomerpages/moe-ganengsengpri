## Art Club

**Teacher 1 I/C:** **[Mrs Chin-Lee Siew Gin](mailto:chin-lee_siew_gin@schools.gov.sg)** <br>
**Teacher 2 I/C:** **[Mrs Caroline Low](mailto:low_kwee_choo_caroline@schools.gov.sg)**

The Art Club is a Co-Curricular Activity that unleashes our students’ creativity. Our students are exposed to different art forms and media and learn artistic skills in areas such as:  
  
1 \.  Painting / blending of colours using oil pastels<br>
2 \.  Paper mache<br>
3 \.  Paper quilling<br>
4 \.  Batik painting<br>
5 \.  Abstract drawing

Our students develop self-confidence when they participate in the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation. They learn to work together collaboratively and give back to the community when they use their talents and skills to create community wall murals like the piece painted at Bukit Merah Central hawker centre to commemorate SG50.
