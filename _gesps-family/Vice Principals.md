<i>School as our Second Home and World as our School!</i><br>
<p align="justify">For our students, Gan Eng Seng Primary School (GESPS) is more than just a place for learning; it is a second home and a caring community where friendships are forged, and lifelong memories are created. We endeavour to create a safe and inclusive environment where every child is valued for his/her unique ability, interest, passion, and is empowered to achieve his/her personal excellence.</p>

<p align="justify">At this second home, our <i>GESPians</i> will learn with grit and care with a compassionate heart to inspire others and make a difference. The school’s holistic education provides our students with a variety of learning opportunities both in school and beyond because we believe that the World is our School – the world being a vast “classroom” filled with opportunities for exploration, inquiry, and learning.</p>

<p align="justify">At GESPS, we promote development and growth in the various domains of an all-round education – cognitive, physical, aesthetic, social, emotional, moral, and leadership – and celebrate the success of our students’ multiple peaks of personal and collective excellence in these domains. We believe that we are all different. We learn in different ways and at different rates. We believe that all our students will do their best and succeed in their own different ways as they learn and grow to be “Learners with Grit” and “Citizens with Heart”.</p>
Welcome to GESPS – Our Second Home!

<p align="justify">School is more than just a place for learning; it is a safe and conducive space for children to explore and build memories. To achieve this, the partnership that exists between the school, parents, and the wider community plays an important role. In Gan Eng Seng Primary School, we are grateful that our partnership has built and deepened over the years.</p>Let’s continue to work hand in hand to give our children a holistic environment to learn and grow.
