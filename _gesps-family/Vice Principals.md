<i>School as our Second Home and World as our School!</i><br>
<p align="justify">A warm welcome to all our families, both new and returning, as we embark on another exciting year together at Gan Eng Seng Primary School.</p>

<p align="justify">The primary school years are a precious and formative time in every child's life. These six years lay the foundation for the development of character, grit, compassion for others and a lifelong love of learning. As educators, we are deeply committed to creating a safe, supportive and conducive environment where every child can thrive, discover their unique strengths, and grow into confident, creative and morally upright individuals.
However, we recognise that the journey of education is not one we undertake alone. The partnership between home and school is fundamental to your child's success and wellbeing. When parents and teachers work hand in hand, sharing the same vision and values, our children benefit immensely. Your involvement, encouragement, and support at home complement the work we do in school, creating a consistently safe and caring framework within which your child can flourish.
</p>

<p align="justify">We invite you to be active partners in your child's educational journey. Whether through regular communication with teachers, participation in school activities, or simply showing interest in your child's daily experiences, your engagement makes a meaningful difference. Together, let’s ensure that these six years are filled with joy, discovery, and growth. Let’s work to help your child reach their fullest potential.

<p align="justify">School is more than just a place for learning; it is a safe and conducive space for children to explore and build memories. To achieve this, the partnership that exists between the school, parents, and the wider community plays an important role. In Gan Eng Seng Primary School, we are grateful that our partnership has built and deepened over the years.</p>Let’s continue to work hand in hand to give our children a holistic environment to learn and grow.
