<p align="justify">For the right learning to take place, I believe the school must be a happy place so that students are happy to come every day. They must feel valued, not insignificant; cared for, not despised; and safe, not intimidated. Indeed, the principles of respect and love are so key that teachers play an important role to support the students in the learning process. It is encouraging to see our teachers talk to the students often, understand their needs and concerns, and provide the necessary push and support to help them taste success. If we only define success in academic terms, not every child will get to taste success. But if we give them exposure and opportunities, every student has something to look forward to, and each child can discover something he or she can excel in. The school's broad-based curriculum exposes our students to many learning opportunities which allow them to explore and try new things. I believe that it is important for students to cultivate a love for learning, and to apply the learning to the good of others. The road to application of learning is far and wide. A student may not seem to be applying his or her learning within his or her six years in the school, but one day, after he or she has left us, he or she may do something to benefit others. That is our encouragement as educators.</p>

<i>School as our Second Home and World as our School!</i><br>
<p align="justify">For our students, Gan Eng Seng Primary School (GESPS) is more than just a place for learning; it is a second home and a caring community where friendships are forged, and lifelong memories are created. We endeavour to create a safe and inclusive environment where every child is valued for his/her unique ability, interest, passion, and is empowered to achieve his/her personal excellence.</p>

<p align="justify">At this second home, our <i>GESPians</i> will learn with grit and care with a compassionate heart to inspire others and make a difference. The school’s holistic education provides our students with a variety of learning opportunities both in school and beyond because we believe that the World is our School – the world being a vast “classroom” filled with opportunities for exploration, inquiry, and learning.</p>

<p align="justify">At GESPS, we promote development and growth in the various domains of an all-round education – cognitive, physical, aesthetic, social, emotional, moral, and leadership – and celebrate the success of our students’ multiple peaks of personal and collective excellence in these domains. We believe that we are all different. We learn in different ways and at different rates. We believe that all our students will do their best and succeed in their own different ways as they learn and grow to be “Learners with Grit” and “Citizens with Heart”.</p>
Welcome to GESPS – Our Second Home!

<p align="justify">School is more than just a place for learning; it is a safe and conducive space for children to explore and build memories. To achieve this, the partnership that exists between the school, parents, and the wider community plays an important role. In Gan Eng Seng Primary School, we are grateful that our partnership has built and deepened over the years.</p>Let’s continue to work hand in hand to give our children a holistic environment to learn and grow.
